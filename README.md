# Angular-Vimeo-API-Directive
An Angular Directive that utilises the Vimeo Froogaloop API

This serves as an example of how you can use the API with Angular with custom play/pause buttons.

Clicking on the custom button will make the video play/pause, clicking on the video's play/pause buttons and finishing the video - notifies the custom button of the state change.
